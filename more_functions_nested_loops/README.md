# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project explores advanced concepts in C programming, focusing on the use of functions, nested loops, and core coding practices. Each task is designed to solidify your understanding of C by working through practical coding challenges without relying on standard libraries.

## Requirements
- Code should be written in C and compiled using `gcc` on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Follow the Betty coding style guide.
- No global variables allowed.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Use of standard library functions (e.g., `printf`) is not permitted. Use `_putchar` for output.
- All code must end with a new line.

## Directory Structure
- **GitHub Repository**: `holbertonschool-low_level_programming`
- **Directory**: `more_functions_nested_loops`
- **Header File**: `main.h` (contains function prototypes)
- Each C file in this directory addresses a specific task related to nested loops, functions, and related concepts.

## Key Learning Objectives
- Use and understand nested loops.
- Create and manipulate functions.
- Differentiate between function declarations and definitions.
- Utilize prototypes and manage variable scopes.
- Compile with strict flags for better code practices.
