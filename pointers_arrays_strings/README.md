# Project Title: Pointers, Arrays, and Strings in C

## Description

This project is a collection of exercises designed to deepen understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. Each program demonstrates specific pointer manipulation techniques or string operations that are essential in C programming. 

The project was created to address common challenges developers face with pointers and memory management in C, reinforcing concepts through practical examples. This repository serves as a resource for both learning and reference, offering solutions to common pointer and array operations.

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-low_level_programming/pointers_arrays_strings
    ```
3. Compile any file using `gcc`:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 <main_file.c> <file.c> -o <output_file>
    ```

## Usage

Each program in this project demonstrates specific operations. For example:
- To test the function that resets a variable to `98`, compile `0-main.c` with `0-reset_to_98.c` and execute:
    ```bash
    ./0-98
    ```
- Follow similar steps for each exercise using the provided main files.

## Credits
